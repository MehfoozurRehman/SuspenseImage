# SuspenseImage

This is a react component that allows you to render an image with a suspense fallback. It is a wrapper around the native `img` element. It has the same props as the native `img` element, with the addition of a `suspense` prop which can be `true` or `false`. You will need to wrap your image in a `Suspense` boundry.
